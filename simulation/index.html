  <h1>A Quick Explanation</h1>
  <p>Each organism (those little spiked things) is made up of different body parts
    of varying lengths. Each yellow spike is an eye, it tells the organism if a wall
    or another organism is in its line of sight, as well as the distance to the wall/organism.
    The blue spike is the "mouth" of the organism, it allows the organism to eat other
    organisms, increasing its fitness. The red spike is the brain, if this is eaten,
    the organism will perish and be removed from the world, in will have its fitness lowered.
    If the organisms touch the walls they will also perish and have their fitness lowered.
    After a certain amount of time has passed, or all the organisms are dead, a new generation 
    of organisms will be produced based on how fit organisms in the previous generation were -
    organisms with higher fitness are more likely to reproduce. Each organism has a CNN as its brain
    that takes in the inputs from the eyes and outputs which direction the organism will move in.
    These will slowly mutate over time, and in theory useful mutations should stick. In the begining the organisms
    will fly randomly in all directions and smash into the walls. Over time, however, they should start to 
    avoid walls and strategically try and hit other organism's brains with their mouths. Enjoy!
